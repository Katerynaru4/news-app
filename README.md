## News app

**[Live app link](https://6272e1457b70ba1fe6734755--exquisite-sundae-cb21bd.netlify.app/)**

App with Firebase authorisation by email using **[news api](https://newsapi.org/)**.
News api requests are only available from localhost, so news is not displayed on production.
Actually newsapi.org api in developer plan is no more working in production.

### Development
```bash
npm run start
```

### Build (production)
```bash
npm run build
```
